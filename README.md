# Tower public roadmap

The public roadmap for [Tower](https://tower.nf) is a place to share upcoming product features and priorities to help our users and customers plan ahead. 

[See the roadmap »](https://github.com/seqeralabs/tower-public-roadmap/projects/6)

It contains current and future developments and allows Tower Cloud customers to provide feedback. The public roadmap outlines the most important upcoming features – it doesn't include most contributions from volunteers outside the company. It is not intended as an authoritative list of upcoming release notes.


## FAQs

**Q: Why did you build this?**

A: We know that our customers are making decisions and plans based on  Tower development. We want to provide users and customers with the insights they need to plan.

**Q: Why are there no dates on your roadmap?**

A: Our priority is security and operational stability. Due to this, we can't provide specific target dates for features. The roadmap is subject to change at any time, and roadmap issues in this repository do not guarantee a feature will launch as proposed.
