## FAQs

**Q: Why did you build this?**

A: We know that our customers are making decisions and plans based on what we are developing, and we want to provide our customers the insights they need to plan.

**Q: Why are there no dates on your roadmap?**

A: Our priority is security and operational stability. Due to this we can't provide specific target dates for features. The roadmap is subject to change at any time, and roadmap issues in this repository do not guarantee a feature will be launched as proposed.

   _Shipped_ - Included in the latest enterprise release.

   _We're working on it_ - Discovery and design work ongoing. We are still working through the implementation details, or scoping the feature out.
   _Ideas_ - We are assessing the ideas before moving forward, thinking through how this might work. This is the best phase to sharae your feedback on how you want to see something implemented.  Use cases and design ideas are more than welcome here.
